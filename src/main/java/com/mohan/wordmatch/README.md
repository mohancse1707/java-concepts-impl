# WordMatch
_Helper program to solve word puzzles (YMMV, depending on the lexicon file you use.)_

This is the actual assignment I was given: [Assignment](Assignment.md)
	
It was supposed to be written in Java, so I divided it in 2 parts:

The main program: [WordMatch.java](WordMatch.java)

And a helper class: [WordMatchLexicon.java](WordMatchLexicon.java)

Just download both of them, compile them with

	$ javac *.java
	
and run it with

	$ java WordMatch
	
And, since it seems I enjoy this monkey coding thing, I decided to refactorize it to a python program. Not graded. Just because I'm nice like that... [WordMatch.py](WordMatch.py)
	
To run it, just do

	$ python WordMatch.py
	
I would even convert it to Python 3 but that is too trivial at this stage so, no.
	
I am also including a text file full of... that Lorem Ipsum thing, so that you can test it on your own: [LoremIpsum.txt](LoremIpsum.txt)
	
For your amusement, this is the report I filed for this program (the Java one), so you can have an idea of what was I thinking at the moment: [Report.txt](Report.md)
	
In short, it fulfills the assignment requirements but I think there are many things that can be done to make it a better program so, if it is of any use to you, go ahead and do a pull request or just download the zip file and play with it...

Enjoy!
